Installation:
=====================

`pipx install git+https://github.com/Keruki2005/battle-of-dots.git`

Make sure you have [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) installed.

Run with `bod` in the terminal.

INSTRUCTIONS TO PLAY (old)
=====================
 - start server and enter number of players (run bod_server.py)
 - enter port, just enter 0, use other numbers when you think other people are playing the game on the same lan/router/network
 - should say waiting for players, will connect with first `PLAYERS` (number of players you entered) number of clients
 - start the clients (bod_client.py)
 - on each client type in the ip address then the port number you typed in the server (e.g. '0')
 - start playing when the pygame window pops up by pressing `p` to unpause, have fun!

INSTRUCTIONS TO PLAY (new)
=====================
- run `bod` in your terminal
- **server (1)**: enter number of players, choose random map or a saved map, enter port, wait for players
- **client (2)**: enter host IP and port, start playing
- **map editor (3)**: paint terrain, place cities, save maps to the `maps/` folder, then host with option 2

Map editor controls
======
- Keys 1–7: water, plains, hill, mountain, forest, clear forest, place/remove city
- Left-drag: paint | Right-drag: pan | Scroll: zoom
- `G`: generate random island | `S`: save | `[` `]`: brush size | `Esc`: quit

Saved maps are stored in `maps/*.json` and can be selected when hosting a server.


Controls
======

Left Click: Grab a unit and draw a line to show it where to go. Release to save the path.

Right Click: Drag the mouse to move your view across the map.

Scroll Wheel: Zoom in and out on the spot where your mouse is pointing.

Spacebar: Send all your saved moves to the server.

C: Delete the paths you drew before you send them.

P: Send pause request.

Terminal: Use the terminal to set the IP/PORT address and restart the client.
